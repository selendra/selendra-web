          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <h4>A. General FAQ for Token Investors</h4>
          <h6>
            1. Is there a minimum or maximum limit for investing in Selendra
            (SEL)?
          </h6>
          <p>
            There is a minimum investment requirement of $10 US dollars (or the
            equivalent in crypto assets), while there is no maximum investment
            limit.
          </p>
          <h6>2. How can we invest in Selendra (SEL)?</h6>
          <p>
            To invest in Selendra (SEL), you must first own Bitcoin (BTC),
            United States Dollar Tether (USDT), or some other negotiable crypto
            assets which you will be able to exchange for Selendra (SEL).
          </p>
          <p>
            To buy and hold BTC, USDT, SEL, or any crypto-asset, you will first
            need to have a crypto wallet application and then use that wallet
            application to deposit and hold your crypto assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            A crypto-asset wallet can be an offline wallet, such as the Trust
            Wallet, or a wallet incorporated into a crypto-asset exchange
            network. Some crypto-asset exchange networks we recommend are
            Binance, Kraken, and Poloniex. Once connected to your favourite
            crypto-asset exchange network, you can purchase BTC, USDT, or other
            popular crypto assets there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of buying through a crypto exchange network, another method
            is to buy BTC or USDT from anyone you may know who is willing to
            sell, but you will still need a wallet in which to deposit your
            crypto asset purchases.
          </p>
          <p>
            An all-around good choice for a wallet is the Trust Wallet, the
            Metamask Wallet, or Selendra's own Bitriel Wallet. All three wallet
            application recommendations above are available through the Android
            and iPhone App Stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Cambodia, to buy crypto assets directly from individuals instead
            of through a crypto exchange network, visit
            http://t.me/cryptonomadex to connect up with a group of local
            professionals who buy and sell crypto assets locally.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other regions around the world, you should be able to find
            similar such groups as http://t.me/cryptonomadex that facilitate the
            direct and independent local buying and selling of crypto assets.
            Once you have your wallet and hold a balance of crypto assets, you
            may exchange your crypto assets for Selendra (SEL).
          </p>
          <h6>
            3. How do we hold, store and keep our crypto assets safe and secure?
          </h6>
          <p>
            Selendra (SEL) crypto assets are now supported by three wallets. An
            all-around good choice for a Selendra (SEL) wallet is the Trust
            Wallet, the Metamask Wallet, or Selendra's own Bitriel Wallet. All
            three wallet applications above are available through the Android
            and iPhone App Stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            All crypto asset wallets require you, the wallet owner, and you
            alone to safely keep, store and remember a 12+ word phrase somewhere
            safe offline. These 12+ words in sequence act as your password key,
            so be careful never to lose or forget your word sequence string.
            There is nowhere and no one to turn to if you lose this password key
            to your wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. What are my risks and rewards in buying and holding Selendra
            (SEL)?
          </p>
          <p>
            Selendra (SEL) is a crypto asset that generates, stores and manages
            value-added through the Selendra Blockchain Network, the interplay
            of a unique network node base, its community of developers, and a
            global network of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with all crypto assets, Selendra (SEL) is a high-risk /
            high-stakes investment. You must consider an equal measure that you
            could lose all of your investment in time or enjoy significant
            gains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selendra (SEL) is a broad-based, long-term investment into the
            global blockchain industry. The Selendra team and a network of
            developers are a dynamic and growing body of innovative technicians
            who deploy blockchain applications to create and capture value-added
            for themselves, their users, and the Selendra network.
          </p>
          <h6>5. How do I know Selendra (SEL) is not some sort of scam?</h6>
          <p>
            Your best defence against any scam is to be well informed and
            knowledgeable about the investment product under consideration. As
            an independent investor, you must perform "due diligence" toward
            investigating the investment product you are about to purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Selendra team of developers has been honest and forthright in
            presenting the technical details, risks and investment potential of
            the Selendra Blockchain Network. The technical details in our "White
            Paper," this FAQ, our open online forums, and the personal
            representations of the founders and developers bring stability and
            accountability to this investment product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Selendra team manages an official public channel and discussion
            group on Telegram to find information archives, support services,
            and the latest announcements. In addition, you may present questions
            and make comments in our open public forum. Please join and
            participate in our community forum here: https://t.me/selendraorg
          </p>
          <p>
            Selendra is an open-source development project with the source code
            stored and managed on Github. Selendra source code is openly
            available for public review, and developer contributions are
            welcomed for consideration. Complete documentation for developers is
            being continually updated and can be found at
            https://docs.selendra.org.
          </p>
          <h6>6. Who is the Selendra team, and what is their role?</h6>
          <p>
            Selena's initial inspiration and seed investment spring forth from
            our sponsoring parent company SmallWorld Venture, a venture builder
            and seed investment fund based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Selendra team has been dedicated to research and development
            within the blockchain industry since 2016. From the beginning, team
            members held on to a long-term focus, envisioning building a
            valuable and practical blockchain infrastructure that would
            effectively serve generations into the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency scams today are mainly variants of pooling together a
            group of unwary investors, pumping up the token price through
            outlandish claims, then quickly dumping the token for a windfall
            profit before the inevitable crash in price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering establishing a position in the newly emerging global
            blockchain industry, Selendra early development team members set
            aside all motivations for short-term gain to focus on long-term
            organic growth and stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hope is for all developers, investors, holders and users of
            Selendra to have a long-term outlook toward contributing lasting
            value to the global blockchain community rather than focusing on the
            short-term gain at the expense of others.
          </p>
          <h6>
            7. How do I trade Selendra (SEL) for other crypto assets such as BTC
            or USDT?
          </h6>
          <p>
            Initially, Selendra (SEL) can be traded for other crypto assets such
            as BTC and USDT on PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toward the end of 2021 and early 2022, Selendra (SEL) will become
            included for trading on major crypto-asset exchange networks such as
            Binance.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mid-2022, Selendra will release its own decentralized trade
            system within the Selendra's Bitriel Wallet, simplifying the process
            for devoted Selendra enthusiasts while opening opportunities for
            Selendra developers.
          </p>
          <h6>8. How and where can I spend my Selendra (SEL) crypto assets?</h6>
          <p>
            Somehow, eventually, merchants and financial institutions will be
            encouraged to accept Selendra (SEL). No one really knows how or when
            this will happen.
          </p>
          <h6>9. What is staking?</h6>
          <p>
            As an incentive for network growth, Selendra (SEL) crypto-assets can
            be acquired through "staking." Staking is a technical term, a
            process performed by "stakers", referring to the distributed process
            of securing and storage of "chains" of digital "blocks" on the
            network. In a technical sense, this distributed "chain of blocks"
            refers to the "Selendra Blockchain Network."
          </p>
          <p>
            The value-added stakers contribute, micro-rewards or small deposits
            of newly minted Selendra (SEL) crypto assets are paid to the
            stakers. Anyone can become a staker, and in this way, receive
            rewards for reducing risk while adding an underlying value to the
            network.
          </p>
          <h6>10. How can I become a staker?</h6>
          <p>
            A staker must first acquire some amount of Selendra (SEL) assets.
            Staking the SELs via live.selendra.org (after mainnet launched) and
            through Bitriel wallet. The best and safest way is to join the
            norminator pools.
          </p>
          <h6>11. How can I become a validator?</h6>
          <p>
            To become a validator, any node has to stake a minimum of Pi *
            10,000 SELs or 31,415 SELs.
          </p>
          <h6>12. What is the mainnet?</h6>
          <p>
            Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain is fully
            developed and deployed, meaning that its transactions are being
            broadcasted, verified, and recorded on the network.
          </p>
          <h6>13. What is the testnet?</h6>
          <p>
            Testnet is a development network used for testing future
            applications and products. Testnet crypto tokens are separate and
            distinct from actual SEL tokens and are not intended to have any
            value.
          </p>
          <h6>
            14. When will the mainnet be launched? How do I know when the
            mainnet has been launched?
          </h6>
          <p>
            The Selendra mainnet is scheduled to be deployed during Q4 of 2021.
            The team announcement will be made via its social channels.
          </p>
          <h6>15. How do I make a deposit into the mainnet?</h6>
          <p>
            Initially, a staker must make a small deposit of SEL crypto-assets
            into the Selendra Blockchain Network. They can only do this when the
            mainnet launches.
          </p>
          <h4>B. Technical FAQ for Developers (in progress)</h4>
          <h6>
            1. Why do you issue Selendra (SEL) on the Binance Smart Chain?
          </h6>
          <p>
            Binance Smart Chain offers lower costs over our next best option of
            Ethereum. The Binance Exchange has a presence in Cambodia, where we
            began, and many users worldwide. In addition, Binance is among the
            most friendly exchanges in Asia.
          </p>
          <h6>2. What is the total supply of SEL (tokens?) to be issued?</h6>
          <p>
            The total supply is limited to and can never exceed 3,141,592,654
            SEL, to be released over decades, similar to Bitcoin. The network
            should cross around half of its supply around year 6.
          </p>
          <h6>3. What is the number of Selendra (SEL) token sales?</h6>
          <p>
            12% of the total token issued or 376,991,118 SEL is reserved for
            token sales.
          </p>
          <h6>4. How does SEL (BEP-20) differ from a SEL (native) token?</h6>
          <p>
            The SEL BEP-20 is a token issued on Binance Smart Chain to help
            kick-start community development through airdrop and token sales.
            While SEL (native) is a token that will issue on the Selendra
            mainnet, after the network launches. The holders of SEL (BEP-20)
            will have to swap for SEL (native) once the mainned network is
            launched at the ratio of 1:1.
          </p>
          <h6>5. Why SEL BEP-20 token?</h6>
          <p>
            The team would like to raise awareness, build community, and
            incentivize developers to build apps to run on the Selendra network
            with our testnet so that our team could gain valuable feedback on
            what best use of time to improve the network. Thus, we decided to
            issue SEL on a live network. Thus, we have SEL BEP-20 on Binance
            Smart Chain.
          </p>
          <h6>6. When and how will I receive SEL native tokens?</h6>
          <p>
            All SEL BEP-20 holders will be notified to swap for SEL native at a
            ratio of 1:1 when the mainnet launches.
          </p>
          <h6>
            7. How do I swap to SEL native tokens? How do I (swap, trade, or
            exchange) from (something) to SEL native tokens?
          </h6>
          <p>
            You will be instructed when it is time to swap. For Bitriel wallet
            users, the process will be more automated, while we hope to
            integrate the swap on other wallets.
          </p>
          <h6>8. When do we get the native token?</h6>
          <p>
            We are planning to have the mainnet launch sometime in Q4 of 2021 or
            Q1 of 2022.
          </p>
          <h6>9. What are the release schedules for SEL tokens?</h6>
          <p>
            SEL tokens will be released according to the released schedule
            described earlier in this document. It has long-term, 15 years
            vesting for teams, 10 years vesting Ecosystem dev fund (foundation
            to be set up and manage the fund), vesting 6 months to 3 years for
            investors, and 21 years for mining/staking rewards.
          </p>
          <h6>10. What is the circulating supply in the next N years?</h6>
          <p>
            Many variables can affect the amount of circulating SEL tokens.
            Staking release schedule, vesting schedule, locked up. The best we
            can predict is shown in the token sections in the whitepaper.
          </p>
          <h6>11. What is the implied valuation of the network?</h6>
          <p>
            Valuing crypto-assets and their network is complicated, and Selendra
            will be no exception. The most popular method is by calculating the
            market cap of the circulating supply (i.e. "last price paid per
            token" x "total circulating supply"). This method is obviously
            flawed in many accounts: it does not capture the underlying value of
            the network, the volatility and fluctuation of these assets, the
            significant security risks associated with these networks and
            assets, nor the value of the technology improvements over time.
            Please do not use this or any other method to value the Selendra SEL
            token or any potential investment without fully understanding how a
            given measure works, what it captures or fails to capture, and how
            other models work.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, taking a release schedule into account, and assuming
            investors choose medium vesting. A scale of SEL token at around 1000
            riel or 0.25 USD could mean a market cap between $0 - $200MM in the
            first one-two years after mainnet launched, with circulating supply
            between 0 SEL to 820MM SEL.
          </p>
          <h6>12. How does vesting work?</h6>
          <p>
            Token subject to vesting has a usage restriction. They cannot be
            sold, transferred, spent, or otherwise made use of on the Selendra
            blockchain. The vesting token will be locked in a smart contract or
            directly in the blockchain blocks. The rate at which restriction is
            lifted would depend on the vesting periods predetermined as stated
            above allocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selendra SEL will be added to the liquidity pool for a token swap on
            PancakeSwap, BitrielSwap, and as well as on exchanges. Hopefully, we
            will be listed on Binance by the time we launch the mainnet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the 12% of total tokens for investors, there will be up to 3%
            for private sale to Selendra advisors. 9% will be for public sale
            via IEO and/or Tokens swap.
