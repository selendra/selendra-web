        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>1. Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>

        <p>4. We use session and persistent cookies on our website as well as the localStorage capabilities of your browser.</p>
