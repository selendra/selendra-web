            <p className='privacy__title'>Cookies</p>
            <div>
              <p>1. Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
              <p>2. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
              <p>3. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
              <p>4. We use session and persistent cookies on our website as well as the localStorage capabilities of your browser.</p>
              <p>5. Blocking or deleting any or all cookies may have a negative impact upon the usability of our Services or may practically exclude you from using them completely.</p>
